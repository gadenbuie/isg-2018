- I'd like to introduce you to one of the participants in our study, who I will 
  call **Dorothy**.
- Dorothy is between 75 and 80 years old, she's divorced, and she lives alone 
  in her home in The Villages.
- Overall, she's in great health. 
- As a typical retiree living in the Sunshine State, she leads a highly active 
  life involving 
      - an assortment of clubs and groups, 
      - dance classes at the recreation center, and 
      - frequent lunches and dinners in the town square with friends.
- She lives alone, but she talks to her daughter regularly, even though they live
  on opposite sides of the US.

- About a year or so ago, though, Dorothy's **recurrent hip pain** worsened and she and 
  her doctor decided for **hip replacement surgery**.
- She arrived at the hospital on the day of the procedure only to find out that due 
  to an insurance issue, she would have to wait another three months.
- In the mean time, 
    - her mobility declined, 
    - she spent more time in bed, and 
    - she couldn't make it to many of the activities she loved.
- Her daughter had planned to visit during this time, but due to a family 
  emergency she had to cancel her plans.
- In the end surgery went well, Dorothy recovered quickly and a few months later
  she was back to living the life she enjoyed.

I'm sharing Dorothy's story for __2 reasons__: The first because... __her experience highlights the challenges__ we face as a society in how we approach aging and manage health care for older adults.

1. She is part of a __growing population of seniors__, one that is expected to double to 98M over the next 40 years

2. __Life expectancy has increased by 3 mon/year since 1840<sup>*</sup>__ 
  - and while 75% of seniors report being in __good to excellent health__, 
  - __a majority are managing chronic health conditions__.

3. More older adults are divorced or live alone than ever before, which in conjunction with demogrph. changes leads to decreased availability of traditional family caregivers

4. Additionally, there is a strong preference to age in place, __like Dorothy__ -- remain in their own homes and communities, for as long as possible (75% want to stay, vast majority 96% live in community)

# HomeSense
]

???

The second reason I've shared Dorothy's story is because, 
- as a participant in our study, 
- she had a home sensor system installed in her home 
- and that system allowed Dorothy's daugher to stay in touch with her mother's daily activities while they waited 4 hip replace

The goal of the system that we call __HomeSense__ 
- is to support seniors who want to age in place safely and independently
- by monitoring daily activities
- in particular focusing on the activities that signal or influence health outcomes

The main compenents of the system are
- wireless sensors installed throughout the home
    - **presence**: PIR motion sensors in all commonly used areas
    - **magnetic contact sensors**: doors, cabinets, fridge access
    - **other**: electricity, temp, luminance, etc.
- the data is collected through raspberry pi in home<br>
  ...then collected, warehoused and processed on our servers
- A suite of tools for internal use such as 
    - a custom inventory management system and 
    - a number of dashboards
- A web interface for users and family/friends<br>
  can review summarized and detailed activity data

### Lifestyle Reassurance

- Alleviate burden of chronic illness with supportive technology<sup>`r refs["Demiris2008a"]`</sup>

- Provide safety and security around changes in health and routine

???

This need for safe aging in place is reflected in our design goal
of supporting **lifestyle reassurance**.

Our objective is to develop supporting technologies such as HomeSense to
alleviate the burden of chronic illness on OA & CGs

A primary goal of such a system is to support safety and security 
by noticing changes in behavior and routine and alerting 
OA/CGs when these occur

### Unsupervised Behavior Change Detection

- Labelled activity data is difficult and expensive to collect`r add_ref("Szewcyzk2009-Annotatingsmartenvironment")`

- Requires solutions without explicit, higher-level activity labels

- Reflects real-world, natural, smart home activity data

.footnote[
`r refs["Demiris2008a"]`: `r Citet(bib, "Demiris2008a")`; 
`r refs["Szewcyzk2009-Annotatingsmartenvironment"]`: `r Citet(bib, "Szewcyzk2009-Annotatingsmartenvironment")`
]

???
<hr>

OTOH, because labelled activity data 
is difficult and expensive to collect –<br>
especially natural patterns of Daily Living –<br>
we need an approach that does not require
explicit, high-level activity labels
and that can effectively make use of real-world, natural SH act. data

name: research

### Research Objective

.big[
>_Can we effectively use passively-recorded
unlabelled sensor data
to characterize lifestyle
activity patterns and enable
detection of changes in routine?_
]

???

To summarize, our research objective is centered on the question...

We will address this question from two angles:

1. Defining *lifestyle activity pattern*

2. Using the AP for behavior change detection

Over the next few slides, we'll touch briefly on<br>
the sensor system and the data that we collected<br>

Then I'll explain our definition of *activity profiles*
and present the results of an experiment to demonstrate
that these activity profiles capture the unique behavior 
of the occupant.

Finally, we'll discuss the method and results of the 
algorithm for behavior change detection.

### Activity Profiles

???

*Faux-animated slides*

- Explain how sensor events are used, divided, processed
- Given example of sensor events
- String representation simply encodes a series of actions
- To get bag of n-grams, take sliding window across event series
- Gather and count each n-gram

---

- Concise representation of sensor activities

- Allow comparison between activities at different time points or occupants

--

<br>

Represent sensor events as daily *event sequences*

1. Use only **active** sensor firings grouped by day

1. Day begins at first 5 active events after 4 a.m.

1. Insert *pause event* when no activity in 15 minutes

1. Summarize event sequence as **bag-of-event _n_-grams**`r add_ref("Hamid2005")`

KL Distance provides a distance measure between probability distributions.

We use KL dist to compare frequencies across b-o-e n-grams (activity profiles)

$D_{KL} (P \Vert Q) = \sum_{i} \left( p_i - q_i \right) \log \frac{p_i}{q_i}$

#### Reframe as supervised learning

*Can we identify the correct occupant for a de-identified day of activity?*

???

Also: If we're creating a baseline profile, how many days are needed?

---

#### Data Collection

**HomeSense** was installed in the homes of
- community-dwelling older adults in The Villages, FL
- who live alone and were of good health

Bi-weekly phone survey tracks health changes, significant life events

???

Read slides...

14 participants, aged 68+

--

#### Data Selection for Activity Profiles

Selected 6 participants:

- homes with similar floorplan & sensor layout

- who completed at least 196 days
    - Excluding vacation, maintenance visits, guests & visitors

???

Because sensor installations varied according to floorplan
we selected a subset of participants with longterm participation
and standard sensor layouts.

### Floorplan and Sensor Layout

<img src="images/simple-exp-covered.png" height="430px">

Included in the sensor network
- motion sensors for the generalized detection
of presence throughout the home
- magnetic contact sensors for detection of
interaction with entrance and exit doors and routinely used objects
- wireless, z-wave

### Evaluating Activity Profiles

#### Experimental Setup

- Create **activity profile** for each occupant from *N* days
    - *N* — 14 days to 3 months
    
- Label test day with occupant of best activity profile match

- 7-fold cross validation
    - Test on each of **28 testing days**
    - Profiles drawn from remaining **168 training days**

???

Note, because profiles drawn from 168 training days, 
I repeatedly draw from training pool so that all folds
have 12 trial total (12 iters, 1 rep -- 2 iters, 6 reps)

- Having validated that the activity profiles are capable<br> 
  of summarizing the activity patterns of an occupant,<br>
  we now turn to the task of behavior change detection

- compare occupant's recent activity to previous behavior<br>
  previous behavior is either a baseline period of normalcy<br>
  or sliding windows

- Given that KL-dist is a scale-less distance metric,<br>
  need to establish bounds guidelines for expected similarity
  *What is normal variation vs. anomaly/change?*

- Overall, our goal is to bring abnormalities to the attention of caregiver<br>
  human review and intervention is expected<br>
  and system issues are equally requiring of attention

- This work can be integrated into a dashboard or notification system
  so that caregivers or admin can be alerted early as behavior patterns shift,
  triggering more careful monitoring
  
- The method for behavior change identification works best on longer-term time horizons --
  i.e. previous month was *unusual* -- but can be coupled with a comparison
  to a baseline period, leading to more fine-grained comparison of
  daily behaviors.
  
- The permutations-based method will be extended to provide more information
  about the differences between windows, by looking at the contribution of
  individual days, hours, or even event sequences over the various permutations.

## Extra stuff


- bag of event *n*-grams method was first validated as a supervised
classification problem
    - activity profiles were used to identify occupants from 6 homes with identical layouts
    - Activity profiles based on 4 and 6 weeks of activity led to correct identification of a given occupant for unlabelled days of activity with high accuracy
    
- unsupervised behavior change was applied to the activity data from four participants
    - over a period of one year (one participant) or two years (three participants)
    - who reported health changes ranging from acute episodes of illness to mobility restrictions leading to major surgery

- Comparison of activity profiles over time windows of 1 to 4 weeks reliably detects major shifts in behavior
