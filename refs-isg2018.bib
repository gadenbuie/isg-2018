  title = {Technologies for an Aging Society: A Systematic Review of "Smart Home" Applications},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A "smart home" is a residence wired with technology features that monitor the well-being and activities of their residents to improve overall quality of life, increase independence and prevent emergencies. This type of informatics applications targeting older adults, people with disabilities or the general population is increasingly becoming the focus of research worldwide. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of health related smart home projects and discuss human factors and other challenges. METHODS: To cover not only the medical but also the social sciences and electronics literature, we conducted extensive searches across disciplines (e.g., Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Electronics and Communications Abstracts, Web of Science etc.). In order to be inclusive of all new initiatives and efforts in this area given the innovativeness of the concept, we manually searched for relevant references in the retrieved articles as well as published books on smart homes and gerontechnology. RESULTS: A total of 114 publications (including papers, abstracts and web pages) were identified and reviewed to identify the overarching projects. Twenty one smart home projects were identified (71\% of the projects include technologies for functional monitoring, 67\% for safety monitoring, 47\% for physiological monitoring, 43\% for cognitive support or sensory aids, 19\% for monitoring security and 19\% to increase social interaction). Evidence for their impact on clinical outcomes is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The field of smart homes is a growing informatics domain. Several challenges including not only technical but also ethical ones need to be addressed.},

  abstract = {We present a novel representation and method for detecting and explaining anomalous activities in a video stream. Drawing from natural language processing, we introduce a representation of activities as bags of event n-grams, where we analyze the global structural information of activities using their local event statistics. We demonstrate how maximal cliques in an undirected edge-weighted graph of activities, can be used in an unsupervised manner, to discover regular sub-classes of an activity class. Based on these discovered sub-classes, we formulate a definition of anomalous activities and present a way to detect them. Finally, we characterize each discovered sub-class in terms of its "most representative member" and present an information-theoretic method to explain the detected anomalies in a human-interpretable form.},

  abstract = {Sensor-based time series data can be utilized to monitor changes in human behavior as a person makes a significant lifestyle change, such as progress toward a fitness goal. Recently, wearable sensors have increased in popularity as people aspire to be more conscientious of their physical health. Automatically detecting and tracking behavior changes from wearable sensor-collected physical activity data can provide a valuable monitoring and motivating tool. In this paper, we formalize the problem of unsupervised physical activity change detection and address the problem with our Physical Activity Change Detection (PACD) approach. PACD is a framework that detects changes between time periods, determines significance of the detected changes, and analyzes the nature of the changes. We compare the abilities of three change detection algorithms from the literature and one proposed algorithm to capture different types of changes as part of PACD. We illustrate and evaluate PACD on synthetic data and using Fitbit data collected from older adults who participated in a health intervention study. Results indicate PACD detects several changes in both datasets. The proposed change algorithms and analysis methods are useful data mining techniques for unsupervised, window-based change detection with potential to track users' physical activity and motivate progress toward their health goals.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},
